# Building-Container-From-Scratch
Building your own container using Linux namespaces and cgroups

Introduction
In this assignment, you will understand how containers work by building one from
scratch yourself. You will also experiment with existing container frameworks.
Before you begin, you are expected to have a good understanding of Linux
namespaces and cgroups as studied in class. You will also benefit from reading
helpful articles online on how to build containers from scratch, like this tutorial.
Every container needs a good root filesystem. The easiest way is to download one
online, e.g., from this link that is provided in the previous tutorial. If you wish to
build a root filesystem yourself, you can find some great resources online like this
talk. This talk demonstrates several tools to build a root filesystem, including
Buildroot.
If you have never used containers before, it is a good idea to install and run one or
more popular container frameworks like LXC and Docker, to understand the
behavior of containers.
Part A: Build your own container runtime
In this part of the assignment, you will write a C/C++ program which will a spawn
a command shell in a container-like isolated environment. The following are the
specifications of this container shell:
The shell must run in separate network, mount, PID and UTS namespaces. You
can achieve this in one of two ways: you can either create these namespaces
beforehand and pass suitable arguments to your program to join the newly
created namespaces, or you can create the namespaces directly from within
your program. You can use some subset of the clone , setns , unshare system calls
or their commandline wrappers. You can use the ip netns shell commands to
create network namespaces. Supporting user and IPC namespaces is optional.
You must pass a root filesystem as an argument to your program, and your
shell must begin execution in the top-level root directory of this root
filesystem. That is, running ls in the shell must show the files in the root of
your new root filesystem.
You must pass a new hostname as an argument to your program, and the shell
must display this hostname upon running the hostname command.
Running the ps command in the shell of your container must display a view of
processes in the new PID namespace. You can achieve this by mounting a new
proc filesystem in the container.
You must be able to demonstrate network connectivity between your
container's namespace and the default/parent namespace by running a client
server application across namespaces. You can choose any client-server
application of your choice. The server must be started from the shell of your

container, and a client running in the parent namespace should be able to
successfully connect to this server and exchange information. The two
namespaces must run with different IP addresses, and connectivity between
these namespaces must be suitably configured via a veth device pair. You must
also ensure that the server code/executable is part of your root filesystem, so
that it can be executed from your container's shell.
You must configure limits on any one resource (e.g., CPU, memory) used by
this container via Linux cgroups. You must also run a suitable program from
the shell to demonstrate that the limits are being enforced. For example, if you
set a limit on the maximum memory that can be used by your container, you
must show that a memory-hungry application run from the shell cannot
consume more memory beyond the configured limit.
You must be able to run multiple of such container shells, and show that they
are isolated from one another. For example, the two separate containers must
be able to start servers listening on the same port numbers (something you
cannot do with regular Linux shell). Further, you must show that the processes
in the two containers are not aware of each other using the output of the ps
command.
Your program must not invoke an existing container runtime like LXC, but
must accomplish the above by directly invoking the cgroups and namespaces
functionality of the Linux kernel.
You must design a suitable demo for your shell, where you will run tests to
demonstrate all of the above requirements, using commands of your choice. For
example, you should start processes and demonstrate the ps command. You must
create resource-hungry applications to demonstrate resource limits, and so on. You
are responsible for writing code for all of these testcases as well.
Part B: Containers vs. VMs (ungraded, optional)
In this part of the assignment, you will compare the performance of VMs and
containers in terms of their virtualization overhead. You can use any container
runtime of your choice (e.g., LXC, Docker) and any VM platform or your choice
(e.g., QEMU/KVM). You can either compare the performance of an application
when it is running inside a VM vs. inside a container, or you can compare the
startup latency or boot times of containers vs. VMs. That is, the performance
metric that is being compared across containers and VMs can be chosen by you.
If you choose to compare application performance, choose any application of your
choice and run it both within a container and the VM. Be careful to allocate similar
resources (CPU, memory etc.) to both the VM and the container. Measure the
capacity or saturation performance (in terms of throughput or requests processed
per second, for example) of your application in both cases. Usually, the saturation
performance of the application occurs when some hardware resource (e.g., CPU or
network) is saturated and running at full utilization. Compare the saturation
capacity of the application when it is running inside a container vs. when run inside
a VM, and draw suitable conclusions. Also compare the container/VM performance
with baremetal performance, i.e., when the application is directly running on the
host without any virtualization. You may want to experiment with different kinds of
applications in different scenarios to reach a well-informed conclusion on the
relative performance overheads of VMs vs. containers.

Alternately, instead of comparing application performance, you may also compare
VMs and containers along other axes such as memory footprint, bootup time, and
so on. Start a large number of containers or VMs in sequence, and measure how
long it takes to boot them. Analyze the difference in startup latencies, and explain
them correctly.
This part of the assignment is open-ended, and there is no one correct answer. For
example, the relative performance of the application in containers vs. VMs will
depend on the application you choose and the workload you run it with. What we
are expecting from you is a careful measurement of performance in both scenarios,
and an analysis/explanation of the results you observe.
Submission and grading
You must solve this assignment individually. You are required to submit code (to
create the container, as well as the test cases) for only part A. Create a tar-gzipped
file of your submission, with the filename being your roll number, and upload it on
Moodle. Grading this assignment will involve a demo/viva with the instructor/TA.
Good luck!
